# MAPS: Model Agnostic Post-hoc Synthetic Data Refinement

MAPS is a novel framework for improving the quality and privacy of synthetic data through post-hoc refinement. It combines fidelity enhancement through importance weighting with privacy preservation through identifiability constraints.

## Overview

MAPS addresses critical fidelity-privacy tradeoff in synthetic data:

1. **Fidelity**: Synthetic data often exhibits distributional bias compared to real data
2. **Privacy**: Synthetic samples may be too similar to real samples, causing privacy risks

The framework operates in two main stages:

1. **Privacy Analysis**: Compute identifiability flags based on sample distinctness
2. **Fidelity Classification**: Train a classifier to distinguish real from synthetic data and estimate importance weights
